            EDA is new to me, from all accounts it is a creative and inspiring place, pushing boundaries. The EDA experience appears to be a collaborative, getting your hands dirty, movable feast, which is what I have been expecting. I believe it is a culture that can make everyone thrive, as long as everyone is on board. I have dabbled in different learning and workplace enivronments, although never one quite like this and am looking forward to immersing myself in EDA's. I believe it will challenge me alot at first, but will then elevate me further than I could on my own, so yes it makes me nervous, but in a good way.
