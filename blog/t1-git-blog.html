            So you have decided you would like to learn to program, great call! But where to start? There are so many different options and places and conflicting opinions out there in the world. I can tell you about what I have learnt about the importance and necessity of having a place to store all of the code you will be writing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Introducing GitHub. There are many reasons to love GitHub, one of them is that it is a phenomenal version control system. A version control system allows you to 'save' changes you make, as you go, it makes a record of that version of your code at that time and place. You will be able to recall any previous version of your work at any time, which is very helpful if you wanted to go back and see what changes have been made and why your website or program you have been working on is now working differently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When you 'save' a version of your work using git it is called a 'commit'. When you do a commit, you add a commit message e.g. add blog post, and git will generate a commit number, making it easy to keep track of any changes being made. 
        </p>
            Other benefits of using GitHub to store your code are that:
              *You dont have to use up the memory on your own computer, as GitHub is similar to the 'cloud'. You can 'download' sections of code that you are working on, onto your computer, but you dont have to have all of your code ever written on your computer. 
              *You can have multiple users work on your project/code, which makes team work a breeze
              *You can have others in the GitHub community help and give feedback on your work 
              *It is what they do, they are the largest code host in the world, so they know what they are doing.
              *It is open source and free to use!
        <p>
             So, before you start programming, make sure you have somewhere you can store your code, and to make it easier on yourself find a place with super version control!
