				<h3>My CV</h3>
				<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
				<p>I am eager to explore a new profession, being that of a junior web developer, in a vibrant, driven atmosphere. I have recently pursued this by immersing myself in the intensive web development programme at Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA). This has given me a solid basis to launch into this new career.

				My previous work in science and health has honed my analytical,  problem solving and project management skills, and so given me a strong foundation for this new step. Being an enthusiastic learner, I constantly seek growth both professionally and personally. I have broad experience across varied work environments and so am adaptable and knowledgeable of different team structures and dynamics.</p>  

				<h4>SKILLS</h4>

				<p>Technical: During my time at EDA I worked on many projects, and learnt and used C#,  Javascript, JQuery, as well as git flow and github. I also learnt how to deploy to the web, and gained a good awareness of good TDD practice. 
				My time at EDA also allowed me to develop my HTML and CSS skills. Prior to EDA I used the CMS Squiz matrix.<br>

				Non-technical: Agile workflow, project management,  ability to communicate effectively, ability to apply myself to fast and continued learning, ability to work in a team by building relationships and fostering awareness of team dynamics.</p>
