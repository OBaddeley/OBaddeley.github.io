This repo contains work derived from my time at Enspiral Dev Academy, an intensive bootcamp style, fully immersive, web development learning program. Most of the work here was purely for learning and not for production of polished end products. 

Some of the group projects I worked on can be found at:
* https://github.com/Kotare-Monopoly
* https://github.com/estherlg1/ConnectFour
* https://github.com/HappinessIndex

Final group project:
* https://github.com/Kotare/kotare.github.io  also at inkling.space
